# Google Merchant Center & Shopify Standard Taxonomy

## 🎯 Your Question

**"If we used Shopify's current internal taxonomy, would this be better for SEO, assuming this is what Google uses for Merchant Center etc?"**

**Short Answer:** **Yes, but they serve different purposes.** You can (and should) use **both**!

## 📊 The Three Taxonomies Explained

### 1. Shopify `productType` (What We're Using Now)
- **Purpose:** Internal organization, URL structure, breadcrumbs
- **Format:** Free-form text (e.g., "Breeches", "Riding Boots")
- **Used For:** 
  - ✅ URL subcategories (`/footwear/riding-boots`)
  - ✅ Breadcrumbs
  - ✅ Internal organization
- **Google Merchant Center:** ❌ Not used directly

### 2. Shopify Standard Product Taxonomy (Category Metafields)
- **Purpose:** Product attributes, marketplace integration, tax calculation
- **Format:** Hierarchical categories (e.g., `Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Clothing Bottoms > Pants`)
- **Used For:**
  - ✅ Google Shopping (via Google Product Category)
  - ✅ Facebook/Instagram Shop
  - ✅ Automatic product attributes (size, color, material)
  - ✅ Tax calculation
- **Google Merchant Center:** ✅ **YES!** Maps to Google Product Category

### 3. Google Product Category (For Merchant Center)
- **Purpose:** Google Shopping feed categorization
- **Format:** Google's taxonomy ID (e.g., `166` = "Apparel & Accessories > Clothing")
- **Used For:**
  - ✅ Google Shopping listings
  - ✅ Google Merchant Center feeds
  - ✅ Google Ads product listings
- **Shopify Integration:** ✅ Shopify Standard Taxonomy maps to this

| Feature | Current (`productType`) | Standard Taxonomy | Google Merchant Center |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|

---

## 💡 Recommendation: Use Both!

### Best Practice: Hybrid Approach

**Use `productType` for:**

- ✅ Breadcrumbs
- ✅ Internal organization

**Use Standard Taxonomy for:**
- ✅ Google Merchant Center
- ✅ Google Shopping
- ✅ Product attributes (size, color, material)
- ✅ Tax calculation
- ✅ Marketplace integration

**They complement each other perfectly!** 🎯

---

## 🚀 Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Add Standard Taxonomy (Recommended)

**Keep your current setup:**
- ✅ `productType` for URLs and breadcrumbs (working great!)
- ✅ `custom.primary_collection` metafield

**Add Standard Taxonomy:**
- ✅ Assign primary categories to products
- ✅ Use for Google Merchant Center
- ✅ Use for product attributes
- ✅ Use for tax calculation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Google Shopping ready
- ✅ Better SEO
- ✅ Enhanced product data

### Option 2: Switch to Standard Taxonomy Only

**Replace `productType` with Standard Taxonomy:**
- ❌ Lose flexibility for URLs
- ❌ Harder to create custom subcategories
- ✅ Better for Google Merchant Center
- ✅ Standardized attributes

**Not Recommended** - You'd lose your custom URL structure!

---

## 📋 How to Add Standard Taxonomy

### Step 1: Enable Category Metafields

1. Go to **Shopify Admin** → **Settings** → **Custom data** → **Products**
2. Click **Add definition**
3. Select **Category** (Standard Product Taxonomy)
4. Configure:
   - **Name:** Primary Category
   - **Namespace and key:** `custom.primary_category` (or use Shopify's default)
   - ✅ Enable **Storefront Access**

### Step 2: Assign Categories to Products

**Manual:**
1. Edit product in Shopify Admin
2. Scroll to **Metafields** section
3. Select **Primary Category**
4. Choose from Shopify's taxonomy (10,000+ categories)

**Bulk:**
- Use Shopify Admin API
- Or CSV import with category IDs

### Step 3: Map to Google Product Category

**Automatic:** Shopify automatically maps Standard Taxonomy to Google Product Categories!

**Manual Override:** If needed, you can set Google Product Category separately in:
- Product metafield: `google.product_category`
- Or via Google Merchant Center feed
